Prompt: How do I embed a PDF file for my resume.html page? 
AI Output/Response: iframe within divs. Accepted the suggestion entirely.  
Prompt: Please help me align my contact information on the left-hand side of the form in a div container.
AI output/Response: CoPilot realigned the contact information on the left-hand side, but also inadvertently changed the input/form data that I had entered in the form. So, I had to undo the suggestion and then restate the questions, specifying that only the design elements should be switched, not the actual content. 
Prompt: Switch my photo on the about.html page to be in the left-hand column as a circle, and the text to be in the right column, please. 
AI Output/Response: The AI performed the column switching very well; I made some adjustments to the padding and sizing. 
Prompt: Please ensure that the remaining pages align with the theme of my index.html page and the about.html page. This includes the header, footer, and a similar color theme. 
AI Output/Response: Made the edits to the pages. I didn’t like the way CoPilot completely changed some of the manual formatting I had already completed, so I had to follow up by not changing the format or structure but rather just the CSS design elements. 
Prompt: Please assist me with the thankyou.html page for when a user successfully fills out the form (in accordance with the form input requirements), redirecting them to a thank-you page that aligns with the theme of the rest of my pages in this portfolio. 
AI Output/Response: Created the content, design, and structure for the thankyou.html page. For the most part, I liked the CoPilot suggestions, but I just made a few modifications/corrections to the design and content elements. 


Throughout my portfolio website, I primarily coded using my experience with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This included the overall structure or elements that I wanted to include within the portfolio, along with the content, design theme, images, and other similar components. However, I utilized AI to help me save time, especially when it came to CSS and ensuring all pages were organized, consistent, and professional. This approach enabled me to leverage AI's efficiency while maintaining creative control over the final appearance and functionality of my portfolio. CoPilot was extremely helpful in ensuring the styling, colors, and themes were consistent across all pages, along with their functionality and UI accessibility. However, I did have to make several changes or modifications to the AI suggestions or edits, because they frequently overrode my existing content and formatting when I only wanted design changes. For example, it altered my form fields on the contact page and the about me section on the about page, which I had specifically created based on the assignment guidelines, requiring me to undo the changes and provide more precise instructions.
